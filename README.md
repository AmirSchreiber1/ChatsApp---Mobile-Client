# ChatsApp---Mobile-Client
An Android mobile client for the [ChatsApp project](https://github.com/AmirSchreiber1/ChatsApp---Web-Server-and-Client), developed as part of the "Advanced Programming" course at Bar-Ilan University. The Android Client enables users to seamlessly interact with other ChatsApp users, including those using the web client, ensuring a smooth cross-platform communication experience.

Key features of the mobile client include:
1. Retrofit Library: Used to simplify interaction between the Android Client and the server, following the predefined API.
2. Room Database: Utilized to display locally saved data before receiving up-to-date data from the server, enhancing user experience.
3. Firebase Notifications: Implemented to notify users whenever they receive a message.
4. SocketIO Integration: Ensures that incoming messages are received and displayed in real time, without the need to refresh the chat's message list.
