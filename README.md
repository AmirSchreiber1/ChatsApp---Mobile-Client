# ChatsApp---Mobile-Client
An Android mobile client for the [ChatsApp project](https://github.com/AmirSchreiber1/ChatsApp---Web-Server-and-Client), developed as part of the "Advanced Programming" course at Bar-Ilan University. The Android Client enables users to seamlessly interact with other ChatsApp users, including those using the web client, ensuring a smooth cross-platform communication experience.

Key features of the mobile client include:
1. Retrofit Library: Used to simplify interaction between the Android Client and the server, following the predefined API.
2. Room Database: Utilized to display locally saved data before receiving up-to-date data from the server, enhancing user experience.
3. Firebase Notifications: Implemented to notify users whenever they receive a message.
4. SocketIO Integration: Ensures that incoming messages are received and displayed in real time, without the need to refresh the chat's message list.

Before using the mobile client, please ensure that the ChatsApp server is running. The server must be running for the mobile client to communicate with other users.
